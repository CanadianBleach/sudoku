# C++ Sudoku
A C++ sudoku game and solver.

This is a c++ project I did to learn. The main portion of my reason was the sudoku solver.
I don't use recursion very often and saw it as a good chance for me to try a few things out!
I also have become very accusomed to python and wanted to focus on redundacy with this too.
So there are lots of checks and steps to ensure the program runs smooth.

# Development Environment
I used GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and C++ with the g++ compiler.
I used four basic c++ libraries, iomanip, fstream, ostream, and iostream.

# Future Work
* I want the the program to also search local paths, so the actual path doesn't need to be known
* I want the program to log the time it takes to solve, as well as the number of recursions it takes.
* I want to add color to the text.
